# Start-a-thon-2023-by-IIT-Madras
Hello, my name is Sounak Dey pursuing B.tech Cse core from Sister Nivedita University and presenting on the topic "IoT-based Garden Sensor". This project was made for the Start-a-thon conducted by Jamsetji Tata Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (JITSIE), IIT Madras.

I have submitted my idea for the start-a-thon in the PowerPoint presentation. Here is the app prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/VAvol2iDFVihYnXd1dC9VZ/IGS-app?type=design&node-id=3-78&t=U3WvYcCNYLTzlpgj-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=40%3A11&mode=design

This is the youtube video explaining my idea in under 5 mins: https://youtu.be/2boJ2Fuj2BA
Sorry for the bad voice, trying to improve it.

Questions/ advice/ flaws regarding this product would be really appreciated
